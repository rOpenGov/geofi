\title{Fetch Data from OGC API (Internal)}
\usage{
fetch_ogc_api_mml(
  api_url,
  limitti = NULL,
  custom_params = NULL,
  mml_apikey = getOption("geofi_mml_api_key"),
  max_pages = 100
)
}
\arguments{
\item{api_url}{Character. The base URL of the OGC API endpoint.}

\item{limitti}{Numeric or NULL. The maximum number of features to retrieve
per request. If NULL, the function first attempts to fetch all available features
without pagination (limit=-1) for speed, falling back to pagination with
a default limit of 10,000 per request if the no-paging request fails.}

\item{custom_params}{Character or NULL. Additional query parameters to append
to the API URL (not currently used in the function).}

\item{mml_apikey}{Character. API key for authentication. Defaults to the value
stored in \code{options("geofi_mml_api_key")}.}

\item{max_pages}{Numeric. The maximum number of pages to fetch during pagination
when \code{limitti} is NULL. Defaults to 100. Increase this value for very large
datasets, but be cautious of long runtimes.}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object containing the retrieved spatial features.
}
\description{
This internal function retrieves spatial data from an OGC API endpoint with
pagination support. It handles both limited and unlimited requests, automatically
paginating through results when no limit is specified. It includes basic error
handling and rate limit handling.
}
\details{
This function is intended for internal use within the package. It uses the \code{httr2}
package to make HTTP requests and \code{sf} to parse GeoJSON responses into spatial data.
When \code{limitti} is NULL, it first attempts to fetch all features in a single request
(limit=-1). If this fails (e.g., due to R's character string size limit), it falls
back to paginating through features by following the "next" links in the API response.
It includes basic rate limit handling for status code 429.
}
\note{
This function is not exported and should only be called by other functions
within the package.
